++Overview++
Going to try to make a *magical* larp jacket.
Microcontroller for the brains, accelerometer for the gestures, neopixels for the lights, 
and a sound board for the lights.
First tried with a DC barebones arduino.  Wasn't happy with the 9v option, so i opted to 
try out the trinket pro.  Have the supplies, now i need to assemble them, then cobble the
code together.

[need to look into using the pins...
for now i'm using the spot you mount the USB plug with some wires...]
USB (+)-(+) on the rails as well as BAT on trinket pro.
USB (-)-(-) on the rails.

++To Do++
Pop it into some perf board.
change test sketch to be useful to get values for the spell casting motions.
get sounds for the spells.
Refine code.
comment some more (intro at the very least and clean this up...).
Win.

++Links used++
As per usual much Adafruit lurking.
