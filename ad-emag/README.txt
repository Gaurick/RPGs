++Introduction.++
So this is the whole of the post apocalyptic role playing game (quite a mouthfull) 
i've been working for over 10 years... It's a pretty big mess, and it was suggested 
at Adafruit that any kind of writing can be dumped here on Git (including novels).  
I really liked the idea of version control and being to see the actual changes from 
one version to another.
So thus it is here.

may upload one of these days for archival.
even more messy than 1.08.

v1.08
latest "complete" version.
that's 8 previous "complete, i won't touch it ever again" versions thus far.

v1.09
TBA

++To Do.++
(this version)
Form into a cohesive and less rambly mass of writing.
Make the rules less like Rifts and more simplified (maybe even my own.)
Stop using commas and parenthesis in notes (and the rest of the document).
Fill with entertaining and not misspelled words.
Make whole game based on the stories and exploits of post apoc heroes (they probably end tragically).

Change everything to be a different system (super random?).
Make Myth-Maker section not stupid (or just replace with a tutorial adventure? or remove for now?)
Put vehicles back in not stupidly.
Change the beastary around a bit to be less boring (more hybrids, or post-apoc, or just different?).
Adjust the cookie cutter villains to accept the new rules.
Fill in reference document with references for consistency of stuff.
make Karl 7.62 Ball’s misspellings more consistent.
double check car-bomb-face-guy’s accent writing.
put in Edd commentary here and there with intro writings for each chapter.
add in writings for each continent with an intro.

centeral aspects to remember...
Randomness is paramount.
Good things have a price.
Stability is sub-par.
XP is spent for improvements.
Actions per turn are based on stats and have a minimum of 1.
Guns are expensive but very damaging and unpredictable.
Melee weapons are cheap and average.
