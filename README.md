# RPGs
Holding file for RPG’s I’m working on.
Currently contains...

**Ad  Emag-** an attempt to recreate a home-brew RPG i collabrated to create.  A post-apocalyptic RPG full of bad jokes and a bit of a mess currently.
**Genericia-** a beginning attempt to make a generic RPG when work on other projects lagged.  Maybe setting agnostic, everything has a value that can be tabulated.  May use microcontroller for mechanics side of things.
**LARP System-** trying to make a generic system to use microcontrollers and IR LED's to LARP it up.  Trying to make it system agnostic and have GM controllers and player modules.
**Singularity-** an excuse to use d16's with hexadecimal numbers on the faces.  Play as AI's trying to make their way in the brave new world.
**Rocket Tots-** had a dream that compelled me to write it.  Solo RPG based on creating post-incident reports for disarming AI's with todler level intelligence attached to weapons of mass destruction.
