**System**
  * goal for game
    * get it out of my head.
      * onto cloud based storage, such as here, to share with other humans.
      * set some details that keep changing in stone so they can be consistent.
      * also it'd be nice to play it one of these days with other people.
    * have a good post-apoc dungeon crawl.
      * i'm leaning more and more to just having job postings and single adventure style.
        * would make writing a bit easier, and i don't know of any systems that do that by default.
        * have option to do long drawn out stories if you want, but designed for self-contained single adventures.
    * have/be a simple, but different rule set.
      * **still working on it.**
    * force characters out of their comfort zone for characters to play as.
      * whole game is based on this, so it shouldn't be too tough.
      * pig-people, wretched, and all the mutations.
  * type of game
    * table top at it's heart.
       * try and keep the system pretty simple.
    * would like to at some point persue a board game type thing.
      * but let's not even entertain it right now.
      * just don't even think about it.
    * hold off on video game day-dreams because that's too complicated for my brain.
      * really let's get the table top system up and running first.
  * feel
    * sarcastic, bad jokes, puns.
      * i can't help it, so why fight it?
    * dirty and re-re-re-reused.
      * perhaps have  lots of modular stuff.
      * also scrappy things to buy to help inspire/give the feeling.
      * finally writting will feature re-using of stuff and help set the tone.
    * randomized.
      * lots of the character's parts are going to be rolled for instead of chosen.
      * don't get too carried away with excessive rolling though.
      * but have enough of it to make characters force the players out of their comfort zones.
    * everything is costly (no benifits without heavy costs).
      * healing is very costly (mutations from the syrum) or very slow (bedrest/first aid).
      * ranged combat is either very expensive per shot or not very damaging.
      * melee combat is standardand not too fancy/overpowered.
      * armor is really cheap for primitive stuff, painfully expensive for "modern" materials.
      * vehicles are same as armor, but anything that isn't muscle powered is ungodly expensive.
  * mechanics
    * dice to roll stuff.
      * i'm leaning to using a full range of dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d20).
      * gives a great range of options.
      * probably going to just use one or two of each per character though (no large dice rolls).
    * pick a system and stick with it.
      * right now it's attributes 4-10 (d4, d6, d8, d10).
        * hope it helps tie in the feeling of short adventures and such.
      * skills are either trained or not trained.
        * trained get 2 dice, untrained gets 1 die to roll stuff.
      * tests = skill d attribute
        * 2d6 for a trained skill and a d6 attribute.
        * vary based on what's going on (ranged combat + senses to shoot and so on).
    * make that system consistent and vaugely balanced.
      * yeah that'll take quite a bit of fussing.
  * damage
    * have some.
    * decide on weapon damage style
      * melee weapons are melee [damage] + [static number].
      * ranged weapons are [dice] x [value].
      * explosives and fire are [dice] x [more dice].
    * create a master list of weapon damage ranges (for balances).
    * create master list of [hp] ranges to compair lethality of weapons (more balancing).
  * xp
    * learn something.
    * xp is spent like currency to improve a character's stats.
    * keep running total of xp for comparison.
    * xp is earned for completing quests, adventures, campaigns (specify what those are).
    * also for defeating/befriending/incapicating/murdering foes.
    * more master lists to track what's considered badass and what's a n00b.
  * currency
    * barter mostly.
    * set a standard rate to measure everything else from (item costs in books mostly).
    * come up with some alternative currencies to play with/inspire.
