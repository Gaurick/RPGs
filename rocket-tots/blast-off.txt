This is a quick RPG/writing prompt where you have to disarm old, unstable cruise missiles containing the first weapons based AI systems.  The systems give the cruise missiles the personality and temperment of a four year old child.  You must find a way to dissarm the weapons without triggering them.  Unless this is a post-incident report, in that case yo will be filling in what information you are able to gather from the site.  Each section of the ID cards and the incident report have a brief description as well as a handfull of possible answer prompts.  You can select any prompt provided, roll a six sided die and use the prompt who's number matches the number you rolled, or make one up off the top of your head.  Or do whatever you want, I won't be checking answers or anything like that.

SAFETY This game deals with subjects of identity, weapons of mass destruction, children or child-like AI systems, death, and destruction.
