Cookie Cutter Villains
The following are a slice of the possible people that the characters could run into. They are
made with their major purpose in being cannon fodder for bored characters. But with some
tweaking and a little imagination they could be used to fill in any role that may be required.
Here they are, the cookie cutter villains.

Marauder
There are two types of people in the world, those that work for a living, and those that steal 
from the people that work for a living. Marauder fit into the second category. They tend to 
roam the countryside like a plague of locus. They also usually follow a single powerful leader 
and are broken down into smaller groups that are assigned specific tasks based on the skills of 
the people in the given group.

Marauder Leader
These are marauders that have survived for some time. They pretty well know how to pillage
and raze the country side. Marauder leaders are mostly in charge of groups of marauders that
vary in size, but usually are from 3 to 15 strong.

Marauder Commander
When you combine charisma, years of conflict, a great lust for conquest, and a group of minions
willing to die for you, you get a marauder commander. These are the people that manage to live
through enough of the horrors of the world to inflict some horrors of their own. Armed with
only the best spoils of their campaigns and harden by years upon years of fighting they make for
very fearsome foes in combat.

Scavenger
With all of the death and destruction that has befallen the world, there lies a great and many
technological goodies lying around to be discovered by anyone who is industrious enough to
search for it. Those that search the ruins of the world for odds and ends to sell off are called
scavengers. Scavengers usually only attack when they are either cornered, or they think that they
can easily defeat whomever they encounter. On average they are dirty, mismatched, and
equipped with salvaged equipment.

Wanderer
Civilization isn’t always for everybody. With the great expanses between cities, it is very possible
to wander about for months without any contact with a single person. This life style is very
attractive to quite a few people. Those that roam the countryside traveling from town to town
would fit into this category. What few items that they possess are usually very sentimentally
valuable to them, and very well worn.

Primate
This is actually a derogatory term for the people who live in communities that have exceptionally
low levels of technology. They tend to be superstitious, easily confused, and quick to anger.
What they lack in technology they more than make up for with their proficiently with the more
basic items and weapons of the world.

Towns person
If two people run into each other while walking through the hazardous world, chances are that
they will walk together for protection. If two groups of people run into each other, then chances
are that they will start a town. Towns typically have some form of protection, such as animals,
trained and armed guards, and/or walls. These are the standard people that go on about their
day to day activities not particularly caring to go out and adventure, quest, or even leave the
safety of their towns.

Town Guard
Towns are very tempting targets for raiders, marauders, and any other unsavory type of person
that wishes to make a quick and easy profit. To keep towns from being scrubbed off the face of
the earth, towns either train or hire people to guard their towns. These guards are usually young
people from the town that are hastily trained and equipped, or they are old and worn out
adventurers that want to settle down. Whichever they are, they aren’t very intimidating alone.
It’s their numbers and the defenses that they fight from that make people think twice about
razing the town to the ground.

Town Leader
As opposed to the brutal and blood thirsty leaders of marauder groups, leaders of towns tend to
be more on the passive and charismatic side of the spectrum. Their position is gained with the
consent of the townspeople. Though they are peaceful, they still know a thing or two about
defending themselves. Being able to and willing to are two very different things though.

Combat Tech
This is a generic term for any person, or group of people who were lucky enough to discover a
substantial amount of technological goodies. Given the difficulty in finding what they possess,
getting it, and holding on to it, it isn’t a big surprise that they are always quite dangerous. The
good news about them is that they do not exist in substantial numbers.

Piloting Tech
People don’t always want to walk from town to town when they need to travel. Given the
dangerous nature of travel between towns, people lucky enough to have vehicles would rather put
weapons on them to protect their expensive investments. So this is where piloting techs come
into play. They take the the time and effort to soup up their vehicles with extra modifications,
weapons, and booby traps. Outside of their given transport, they are only marginally
intimidating. Inside their vehicles they are terrifying.

Psychopath
Sanity just isn’t for everybody. When a person decides that their own form of reality is a better
place to stay at then the currently accepted one, they become a psychopath. They could be
anything from comatose to raving madmen who crave nothing more than to kill without any
remorse. A comatose person isn’t really worth making up stats for, so it would logically follow
that the people represented here are the diabolical “Let’s kill everyone that we can see” type of
person. They are very unstable and it would be futile to even begin to attempt to predict what
they would do in a given situation.

Naturalist
With the great bounty of genetically diverse florin and fauna throughout out the world, one
doesn’t need to look far for various drugs that may be required. The difficult part comes in when
one wants to distinguish the effects of the plants and animals. This is a very desirable trade for
people that wish to live off of the land. These people aren’t very aggressive, but they will defend
themselves when the are required to. They are mostly known for what poisonous potions and
helpful brews they can make for those that find them and meet their prices.

Deviant
When everything starts falling appart around you, there are typically two roads one can take.
The first is you grit your teeth and do what is necessary to help yourself and those around you.
This is generally the preferred method.  The other method is to draw everything you can to 
yourself.  Disregaurd everyone around you and turn all your attenting inward.  Those that go down
that path become Deviants.  Their tastes are as varied as the number of stars in the night sky, 
ranging from obsessively pressing wildflowers to cannibalism.  Most leave them to their demented
ways, so long as it doesn't put them in danger.

Bestiary
This section is dedicated to the animals that roam the world. The following animals are hardier
than what had existed before the plague. As Darwin said, “Only the strong survive,” and animals
are the embodiment of that philosophy.

Bears
Bears are large and furry animals that are much larger than people. They don’t tend to be overly
aggressive except when they are protecting their young or when they are desperately hungary.
They live in caves near or in forests or basements and cellars of abandoned buildings.

Birds
Birds are the species that have control of the air. As a group they all have beaks, feathers, and
wings. Birds are either carnivores or vegetarians, with vegetarians being non-aggressive and
carnivores being the aggressive side. They tend to nest up high off the ground in trees, attics, or
skyscrapers.

Snakes
Most of the snakes that have survived all that has happened to the world have done so for two
reasons. Firstly they are all exceptionally poisonous. Secondly they are overly aggressive. They
are long, thin, and without limbs. They live anywhere that is cool, dark, and secluded.

Wild Dogs
In the days before the plague a lot of people kept dogs for pets. When nearly all of the animal’s
masters died off, the dogs escaped and began to roam through the countryside. Dogs will live
where ever they can, and tend to run in large packs.

Large Cats
Of all the cats that survived the events that nearly ended the world, the larger more feral cats are
what most people worry about. They are half as tall as an average person and they are as long as
a person is tall. Large cats make their dens in spaces that are hidden from people, such as
abandoned buildings, caves, or in forest clearings.

Deer
Before the plague deer were passive and hunted for food. Unknown events made them into
overly aggressive animals. They have been known to attack humans on sight. Otherwise they
have changed little physically.

Rat
Rats not only survived the plague, but prospered. Being scavengers they have plenty to eat. Rats
alone aren’t that intimidating, but if encountered in a pack, they tend to swarm and overwhelm
their young, sick, wounded, or sleeping victims. They live anywhere they can.

Frog
Frogs were the only species as a whole that were radically mutated. The frogs were experimented
on when the syrum was being researched, and a family of gigantic frogs escaped. The giant frogs
reproduced and overwhelmed the normally sized frog population. The larger frogs will eat
anything. They will eat people, pets, or anything else that they can fit into their mouths. They
live in swamps, bogs, or near rivers or lakes.
