Attributes
Attributes are the number of dice.  Skills are the sides of the dice.

Combat
  Melee
  Ranged
Defense
  Absorb
  Mitigate
Social
  Deceive 
  Persuade
Support
  Enhance
  Restore
Upkeep
  Construct
  Repair

Combat attributes are leveled separately, but are initially based on attributes and skills.

Actions
Flesh
Initiative

Attributes are the number of sides on the die you use. 


Mutations
Mutation categories are based on attributes

If you have one mutation that alters an attribute altered by another mutation, the old one goes away and the new one replaces it.

Main stats


Attack
Used for aggressive actions
Improves "to hit"
Items are weapons
Weapons improve damage


Defense
Used to protect from death
Gives HP
Items are armor
Armor reduces chance of damage


Support
Used to bolster self and others
Gives skills
Items are tools
Tools allow skills to be used


Syrum
Reserves of instant alter
Allows character to do things
Item is more syrum
Gives you syrum to spend like mana


Mutations branch off of main attribute
Enhance, penalize, or adjust attributes
May be chosen but require X level of Y attribute
Strains give you base starting points for attributes.
Xp gives you more syrum retention

Board game building dungeon crawl.

Make mutations and especially strain bonuses and penalities much larger and "game changing". Arrange mutations in groupings based on type. Maybe make even ones statistical bonuses and odds story bonuses. 


Items and mutations do lots of damage. Bare hands, not so much. Reduce attacks to 1 or 2 per "weapon" (eg. Aimed and normal shot, punch and kick, ect.) 


Minimum skill abstract level 1-3 adds 1 to untrained skills. 4-7 adds 2 to untrained skill level. 8-10 adds 3 to untrained skill level. 


Maximum skill = stored except for current career's skill. That is unlimited.


Learnable gives bonus skill points to spend? 1-3 = 0; 4-6 = 1; 7-9 = 2; 10 = 3?


Sub conscience gives you that many hints from the mythmaker to ask. 


Senses= game initiative 


Bones = flesh
Muscles= 1-3=1, 4-6=2, 7-9 = 3, 10 = 4
Tendons = actions
Skin = appearance
Metabolism = attribute point bonus per rank. 1-3 = 0; 4-6 = 1; 7-9 = 2; 10 = 3


Damage and armor are to be base 10. 1=worthless, 10=ultimate. To damage or absorb damage roll equal to or under number. Also keep rest of game base 10 for modular sake. Except flesh. Set to 20 as base? Try to figure out bones to flesh conversion?

Rules
d10 based system.
 Roll equal to or above an attribute to succeed

attribute tests
skill tests
combat
Combat is as follows...
   1 attacker rolls attack skill to hit
   2 defender rolls armor to absorb blow
   3 attacker rolls weapon's damage to injure
   4 apply damage to flesh (-1 per blow) 

vehicles
experience
  life experience
  career experience
changing careers

Attack
  Melee
  Ranged
Defense
  Mitigate
  Soak
Social
  Deceive 
  Persuade
Support
  Sneak
  Heal

1-20 system, 1-5 being startup, 6-10 being veterans, 11-15 being elite, and 16-20 being master

System should be modular, consistent, and not bad.

Standard rule is you have 50/50 odds to succeed. Attributes average are 50% max. Every rule for characters either manipulate or break these rules

Skills
Trained skills double the number of dice on a test.
You get two trained skills barring mutations.

Rising in rank has rank bonuses (such as getting a cash bonus for being promoted to manager, or minions) at regular pre-determined intervols within the ranks. Default increases include player's level up bonuses, but also include training. Training includes options such as various attribute training, company perks (bonus loot, cash bonuses), or other services (lodging, travel, flesh) 


"Quitting" means that you no longer receive quests, hours bonuses or perks, and you are probably banned from the company's property. It does allow you to start a second job. You would have to start at the bottom rank for hours and such. Maybe transfer the rank, mythmaker's decision. All previous xp and (non company owned) gear is kept. 


Ranks cut off access to perks from lower tiers, yet grant access to higher new tiers. Maybe 8 ranks per job perhaps? Based on cashier, senior cashier, assistant manager, department manager, assistant store manager, store manager, assistant district manager, district manager. Can't achieve vice president or president rank just yet? Or make it uber difficult. Perhaps for another collection (expansion?) 


Training comes in tiers and has previous tier requirements. Come up with some kind of damper on having characters just take all training tiers possible. Like make overtime hours "spent" on company perks, and on the job training have an out of pocket or time cost. 

for on the job training, have it be "At x work hours, you can choose from y training." then have various "training programs" available. 

Highest promotions within a career requires X hours of THAT career to get promotion. also under starting equipment perhaps give item information? and don't forget to make charts for on the job training bonuses, quartermaster spreads, levels within pay grades, re-work the level up bonuses to enhance or fill in gaps of the on the job training, and re-look at the whole game system core itself. 


Shamen start out with modern medicine techniques the advance into primitive techniques. Modern being very materalistic and requiring a lot of stuff. Primative being more renewable and more skill based. 

Overtime gives 1.5x xp AND 1.5x coin. 

Training... something like 10 evenly spaced xp "tiers". Each tier grants passive stat "level up" bonuses (small and to fill in any holes players notice.) Also grants training. Perhaps select one primary (can change from tier to tier) skill or attribute boost and one secondary derrived attribute or other skill boost. Bonuses to be small (but bigger than passive bonuses.) In the +5% range? Could also put half way attribute bonus of +1? (Pending attribute re-work...) 

Get rid of jobs and make it just training. xp = Hours of Experience. Training is for skill improvements. Require certain Hxp, minimum skills, coin payment and possibly previous training tiers. After having ways to improve skills, attributes, and derived attributes, allow players to use services, such as transportation services, mercs, researchers, foargers, and anything else i can come up with. First training list should probably be pay grades. They require hxp levels and increase automatically. Hxp is earned during quests and missions. 


Training starts off in large-ish sizes and as you progress the bonuses become smaller and smaller. Training levels can only be taken once. Same with pay grades. of course... 

Base 10 everything. Stats 1-10. 10 mutation categories, 10 mutations per category (also make mutations simpler and enhance a particular specific aspect). 10 skills with 5 training levels. 10 careers 5 ranks per career. 10 strains? 5 mutations per strain perhaps. 

Starting a new carieer starts you at the base level. Require xp in that career field to advance. Have stat to track total xp just as a representative figure. Every level choose one of the following +1 particular attribute, +1 skill tier, or a specific occupational bonus. So each career a particular skill, attribute, specific item bonuses and maybe npc's for particular tasks. 

Manigerial perks.  Allow max rank careers to continue recieving level up bonuses at regular levels of xp.


Promotions allow you to select a perk from your new rank or from any rank below.  Skills and attributes are to "+1 to bla up to whatever level i want it to be".

 Combat is as follows...
 1 attacker rolls attack skill to hit
 2 defender rolls armor to absorb blow
 3 attacker rolls weapon's damage to injure
 4 apply damage to flesh (-1 per blow) 


 Blood loss
 If a weapon has bleeder in the notes it causes blood
 loss with a successful attack that causes damage.
 Every other turn target rolls metabolism. Success = no
 more blood loss. Failure = -1 flesh and another blood
 loss roll in 2 turns.
 Poison
 Poisons introduced have strength just like weapons and
 a time. Time is how long between poison "attacks".
 When the time has elapsed roll metabolism to resist
 damage. Success = one final "attack" then the poison
 ends it's effectiveness. Failure = poison "attack" then
 another after the time of the poison passes.
 Radiation
 Same as poison. But instead of damaging flesh, every
 failure = -1 from a random attribute
 Vehicles
 Same as people, but more damage can be taken. Also ,
 different name for flesh
 Fire
 Fire size is difficulty that has to be tested against per
 turn. Every failure = damage, then damage +1. So turn
 1 =-1, turn 2 =-2 ect.
 Explosives
 Same as guns but do d10 damage if they pass through
 their armor.
